    <h1>My Love❤️</h1>
    <p>
      When I first saw you, I had no idea you would become someone so special to me. 
      I was skeptical about you. I thought you were a self-centered, arrogant girl and that we would never find a common language. 
      But I guess first impressions can be deceptive, because today you mean the world to me.

  <h2>When Everything Changed</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- paste part of your story here -->
    I clearly remember the moment when my opinion about you changed. 
    You were in the lecture, sitting on one side of the table surrounded by boys, and you wanted to move to the girls’ side. 
    I thought you were fine there, but still asked if you were comfortable sitting there. 
    You replied, in the cutest voice, that you would like to sit with the girls.
     At that moment, my heart melted. I didn’t know I could feel something like that again.</p>
    <p>Not gonna lie, I really felt something for people in the past, but I had actually given up on it. 
     I thought all that lovey-dovey stuff was not for me — until I discovered the kind of person you are.
     I tried to talk to you more — through social media, in real life, even forcing the whole group to let me arrange everyone into teams just so I could be in the same group as you. 
     It was difficult, but somehow it worked. Then I tried to find common topics to talk about. I even forced you to start watching anime, even though I didn’t finish the movie you recommended to me.
     I didn’t fall for you at first glance — it happened gradually.</p>

  <h2>Falling For You</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- paste next part -->
    The more we talked, the more I wanted to know about you. 
    I felt that you had hidden sides that you didn’t want to reveal to people, and regardless of that, I tried to somehow sneak into your life. I wasn’t very persistent before that time, but that’s when I realized that something was happening inside me.
    The time we spent together during preparation was irreplaceable, and I’m happy that we shared that experience. From that moment, I truly understood that something was changing inside me.</p>
   <p>I also remember being seriously jealous once. It was when you were on a phone call with your friend. I had no valid reason to feel jealous, but I was. That’s when I understood that I was getting attached to you. From my past experience, attachment was a bad thing. My old self used to repeat affirmations to avoid becoming attached to anyone — even my parents. That’s why I was afraid that my past patterns would repeat.</p> 
    <p>Then the preparation for your birthday began, and I did my best to make that day special for you. About a month before your birthday, I prepared myself to confess that I liked you. I told most of my friends, and they all said the same thing — to shoot my shot. Honestly, I thought you were out of my league, and I was preparing for rejection. I was ready to calmly disappear from your life after confessing.
    The preparation went almost perfectly. The birthday itself was good as well, except for the Huma part — but never mind him. Seeing you smile was enough for me. That alone was a success.</p>
    <p>I was going to confess that day, but I changed my mind and arranged everything for December 11th. I was extremely worried. It was tough, but I did it. And I was truly surprised that I didn’t receive an instant “no.” You gave me a chance and even shared your feelings after the confession. I valued that deeply. And then… you know what happened.
    So far, I keep looking for your flaws, but I haven’t found any.</p>

  <h2>What You Mean To Me</h2>
<p>
    <!-- paste next part -->
    You are flawless to me. I like how humble you are, but not as much as you are today. I want you to have confidence in yourself, and I will shower you with compliments and affirmations until you truly believe in yourself.
    Sometimes you say that you are not good enough, but for me you are literally ideal. If you name ten bad things about yourself, I will name a hundred things I love about you. </p>
<p>I hate when you underestimate yourself while looking so cute that I can’t even control myself.
    I always ask to hear your voice, to see you for a moment, to send me your photos — because seeing you makes me happy. Every problem I have simply disappears. I don’t have enough words to express how much I value you. It may sound exaggerated, but I truly cannot. I have tried many times, but every attempt feels insufficient.</p>
<p>When I confessed, I said that love is a very big word and that I didn’t think I loved you, but only liked you. But everything changes over time. Now, day by day, I become more confident that what I feel is not just liking — I think I am starting to love you.</p>
<p>I don’t want to think too much about the future because I tried that before with someone else, and everything failed. Whenever I make plans, something happens that ruins them. I don’t want the same thing to happen with you, because this could become my greatest success — or my greatest failure.
    You once said not to make someone the center of your universe, but to be the center yourself. I am truly trying to do that, and I hope I will succeed someday. But for now, I guess I can’t — because you already hold that place.</p>

  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- paste next part -->
    The future is scary. I overthink many things. Even unintentionally, I think about a future with you.</p>
    <p>There are many things that worry me — your parents, my parents, your nationality, how you will see the future, your plans, my worldview, the fact that we don’t share a common language except English and Russian, what if I am not good enough for your parents or for you, what if my mother doesn’t approve of us, what if distance separates us. There are so many difficulties that it’s hard to even count them all.</p>
    <p>Thinking about the future sometimes clouds my mind. It feels incredibly complicated to make something out of all this. But when I look at you — when I see how amazing you are — I forget about all these problems. I realize that these challenges are small, and everything can be solved if it is with you and for you.
    I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but I want to discover it together with you.</p>
